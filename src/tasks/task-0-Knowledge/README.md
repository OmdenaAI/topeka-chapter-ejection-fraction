<h1>Task-0-Knowledge</h1>

The purpose of the Knowledge Task is to amass a comprehensive collection of articles, blogs, and research papers, with a specific focus on the subject of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) measurement. Our intent is to advance our understanding of current methodologies, the application of artificial intelligence in this domain, potential solutions, and available tutorials. This systematic and rigorous approach aims to foster a deeper grasp of the topic, paving the way for innovations and effective problem-solving in the field of LVEF assessment.
