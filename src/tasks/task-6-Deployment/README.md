To run the code using these dependencies, please follow these instructions:

1. Ensure that you have Python and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
2. Install the required Python packages by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Install or update npm globally by running the following command:

```
npm install -g npm
```
4. Install the localtunnel package by running the following command:

```
npm install -g localtunnel
```
5. Run the following command to update npm again (optional):
6.
```
npm install -g npm
```
6. Run the following command to start the Streamlit application and redirect the output to a log file:

```
streamlit run /path/to/app.py &> logs.txt &
```
Replace /path/to/app.py with the actual path to your app.py file.
This command runs the Streamlit application in the background and writes the output to logs.txt.

7. Finally, run the following command to expose your local Streamlit app using localtunnel:

```
npx localtunnel --port 8501
```

This will generate a public URL that you can share with others to access your Streamlit app.

Please note that you may need to adjust the file paths and port numbers according to your specific setup.
