  st.markdown(""" The AI model developed in this project aims to automate the measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) during echocardiography. Manual measurement of LVEF is currently time-consuming and prone to variability, which can lead to inaccurate diagnoses and treatment plans. By automating this process, the workload of healthcare professionals can be reduced, and patient outcomes can be improved by enabling more precise diagnoses and personalized treatment plans.

  The resulting solution is an example of how AI can be integrated into clinical practice, which can lead to more widespread adoption of echocardiography for precision medicine. This can have significant benefits for patients, as echocardiography is a non-invasive and relatively low-cost imaging technique that can provide valuable information about the heart's structure and function. By improving the accuracy and efficiency of echocardiography, the AI model can help to make this technique more accessible and widely used, ultimately improving patient outcomes.""")
