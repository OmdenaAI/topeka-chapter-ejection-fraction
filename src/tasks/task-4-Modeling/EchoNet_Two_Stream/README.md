Running scripts in a Kaggle environment changes things slightly due to the structure of the Kaggle workspace. Here's how you can adjust:

1. Upload your requirements.txt, main.py, and train.py files to your Kaggle workspace.

2. Next, open a new Kaggle notebook.

3. In the first cell of your notebook, you can install the required dependencies using the requirements.txt file. This can be done with the following command:

```
!pip install -r ../input/your-dataset-name/requirements.txt
```

Replace your-dataset-name with the name of the dataset where you have uploaded your requirements.txt.

4. You can then run your Python scripts directly in the notebook cells using the following commands:
```
%run -i ../input/your-dataset-name/main.py
%run -i ../input/your-dataset-name/train.py
```
Again, replace your-dataset-name with the name of the dataset where you have uploaded your scripts.

5. Then you can simply run your entire notebook. The %run command will execute your Python scripts as if they were programs, with command line arguments passed as arguments to the scripts.
Remember to adjust the paths in your scripts to match the file structure in the Kaggle workspace. For example, data files should be located in ../input/your-dataset-name/.

Also, Kaggle's environment comes preinstalled with many common data science libraries, so you might not need to install all the packages listed in requirements.txt.

Please note that if your scripts require command line arguments, you'll have to adjust the %run command and potentially modify your scripts to accept these arguments correctly.
