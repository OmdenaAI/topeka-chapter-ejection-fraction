<h1> Task-1-Data Collection </h1>

Task-1, Data Collection, is an integral part of our project that primarily involves the systematic gathering of a broad range of relevant resources, including datasets, articles, and research studies, specifically in relation to Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) assessment. The core objective is to assemble high-quality and diverse data, which will serve as a solid foundation for subsequent analyses. This process is crucial in understanding the landscape of LVEF measurement techniques, gaining insights on artificial intelligence applications in this area, identifying potential innovative solutions, and uncovering valuable instructional materials. This comprehensive data collection effort is the first stepping-stone towards developing robust, AI-driven solutions for LVEF assessment

Below is our dataset tracker during the initial phase of our project. We elected to use the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset.
